            Using Time Estimation Performance as a Secondary Task Measure of Workload
            
            <p>
            Time estimation has shown to be a good secondary task for measuring workload.
            However gathering time estimation data can be challenging for researchers due to the number of data points that are gathered and feedback regarding the accuracy can be difficult to give to the participants. This portable iPhone application has been created to help in the gathering of such data.
